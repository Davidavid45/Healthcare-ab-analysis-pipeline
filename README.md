# Healthcare-ab-analysis-pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the ability to work with **DBT, Snowflake, and Airflow** to build a **healthcare claims data pipeline**. The goal was to **ingest, transform, and analyze** claims data while performing **A/B testing** on total paid amounts.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **DBT** – For data transformation and modeling
- **Snowflake** – As the cloud data warehouse
- **Airflow** – For orchestrating and scheduling pipeline runs
- **Python (Snowpark)** – For analytical processing in Snowflake
- **Pandas & SciPy** – For statistical analysis in Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 A/B Testing Analysis
**Objective:**  
The A/B test was conducted to evaluate the difference in **Total Paid Amounts** between **Group A and Group B**.

### Hypothesis:
- **H₀ (Null Hypothesis):** No significant difference between Group A and Group B.
- **H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis):** A significant difference exists in Total Paid Amounts.

### Key Steps:
1. Loaded the **FACT_AB_TEST_DATA** table from Snowflake.
2. Performed **data exploration** and checked for missing values.
3. Used **Shapiro-Wilk test** to check for normality (data was not normally distributed).
4. Conducted **Mann-Whitney U test** (since data was non-parametric).
5. Visualized distributions using **box plots & histograms**.

#### **Results:**
- **p-value: 0.70** (Mann-Whitney U Test)
- No statistically significant difference between **Group A and Group B**.
